Introduction
This project aims to analyze the AB_NYC_2019 dataset through data visualization techniques. The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019.

Dataset Information:
Dataset Name: AB_NYC_2019
Source: Inside Airbnb
Description: The dataset includes various attributes of Airbnb listings such as location, price, number of reviews, availability, etc.
Univariate Analysis
In univariate analysis, we examine the distribution of individual variables in the dataset. This helps us understand the characteristics of each variable independently.

Variables Explored:
Price: Distribution of listing prices.
Neighbourhood Group: Distribution of listings across different neighborhood groups.
Room Type: Distribution of listings based on the type of room (e.g., entire home/apartment, private room, shared room).
Number of Reviews: Distribution of the number of reviews received by listings.
Visualizations:
Histograms
Box plots
Bar charts
Bivariate Analysis
Bivariate analysis involves examining the relationship between two variables in the dataset. This helps us understand how variables interact with each other.

Variables Explored:
Price vs. Neighbourhood Group: How does the price of listings vary across different neighborhood groups?
Price vs. Room Type: Is there a difference in price based on the type of room?
Number of Reviews vs. Price: Do listings with higher prices tend to receive more reviews?
Availability vs. Neighbourhood Group: How does the availability of listings vary across different neighborhood groups?
Visualizations:
Scatter plots
Box plots
Heatmaps
Bar charts
Conclusion
Through univariate and bivariate analysis, we gain valuable insights into the distribution and relationships of various attributes within the AB_NYC_2019 dataset. These insights can inform pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and decision-making processes for both Airbnb hosts and potential guests.
